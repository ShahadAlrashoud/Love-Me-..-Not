# Love Me .. Not 

A minimalist, interactive digital daisy-plucking game. This project reimagines the classic "He loves me, he loves me not" game with a modern, inclusive, and tactile web experience.

## Features
* **Interactive SVG Flower**: High-quality SVG petals that users can physically "drag" to pluck.
* **Inclusive Pronoun Selector**: Toggle between "He", "She", and "They" to customize your experience.
* **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth "pop" transitions and color shifts as the "fate" of the flower changes.
* **Randomized Outcomes**: The logic starts with a 50/50 chance of a positive or negative result each time you reset.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) devices.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5/CSS3**: Uses CSS variables for a clean, customizable color palette.
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS logic with no external dependencies or libraries.
* **SVG Geometry**: Path-based graphics for a crisp look at any zoom level.

## How to Play
1. **Choose a Pronoun**: Use the selector at the bottom to set the subject.
2. **Pluck Petals**: Click and drag any petal away from the yellow center.
3. **Follow the Text**: Watch the status update as each petal falls.
4. **The Verdict**: Once the 7th petal is pulled, the final answer is revealed.
